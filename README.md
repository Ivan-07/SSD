# Road and bridge inspection and loss assessment system of UAV Based on CNN

路桥病害探测系统 

（1）Making road disease data set 

（2）Image preprocessing

（3）Make label: make the corresponding label of the preprocessed image as the label of the target detection image.

（4）Training model: using single SSD detection algorithm to detect road diseases, identify and classify the diseases

（5）Real time transmission of UAV image: the video image acquired by UAV is transmitted to the server in real time. The server uses the algorithm to segment the video and get the result of disease identification

（6）Automatic tracking of UAV: the UAV flies according to the established route, and detects and analyzes the flying over the road
